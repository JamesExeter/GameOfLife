/**
 * Implements a class representing a 2d grid of cells.
 *      - New cells are initialized to Cell::DEAD.
 *      - Grids can be resized while retaining their contents in the remaining area.
 *      - Grids can be rotated, cropped, and merged together.
 *      - Grids can return counts of the alive and dead cells.
 *      - Grids can be serialized directly to an ascii std::ostream.
 *
 * You are encouraged to use STL container types as an underlying storage mechanism for the grid cells.

/**
 * Grid::Grid(square_size)
 *
 * Construct a grid with the desired size filled with dead cells.
 * Single value constructors should be marked "explicit" to prevent them
 * being used to implicitly cast ints to grids on construction.

 * Can be implemented by calling Grid::Grid(width, height) constructor.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      // Make a 16x16 grid
 *      Grid x(16);
 *
 *      // Also make a 16x16 grid
 *      Grid y = Grid(16);
 *
 *      // This should be a compiler error! We want to prevent this from being allowed.
 *      Grid z = 16;
 *
 * @param square_size
 *      The edge size to use for the width and height of the grid.

/**
 * Grid::merge(other, x0, y0, alive_only = false)
 *
 * Merge two grids together by overlaying the other on the current grid at the desired location.
 * By default merging overwrites all cells within the merge reason to be the value from the other grid.
 *
 * Conditionally if alive_only = true perform the merge such that only alive cells are updated.
 *      - If a cell is originally dead it can be updated to be alive from the merge.
 *      - If a cell is originally alive it cannot be updated to be dead from the merge.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      // Make two grids
 *      Grid x(2, 2), y(4, 4);
 *
 *      // Overlay x as the upper left 2x2 in y

 * @param x0
 *      The x coordinate of where to place the top left corner of the other grid.
 *
 * @param y0
 *      The y coordinate of where to place the top left corner of the other grid.
 *
 * @param alive_only
 *      Optional parameter. If true then merging only sets alive cells to alive but does not explicitly set
 *      dead cells, allowing whatever value was already there to persist. Defaults to false.
 *
 * @throws
 *      std::exception or sub-class if the other grid being placed does not fit within the bounds of the current grid.

/**
 * Grid::rotate(rotation)
 *
 * Create a copy of the grid that is rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees.
 * The rotation can be any integer, positive, negative, or 0.
 * The function should take the same amount of time to execute for any valid integer input.
 * The function should be callable from a constant context.
 *
 * @example
 *
 *      // Make a 1x3 grid
 *      Grid x(1,3);
 *
 *      // y is size 3x1
 *      Grid y = x.rotate(1);
